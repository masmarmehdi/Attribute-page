      <h2 id="head-of-paragraph"><strong>here's some characteristics of Einstein that people who admire him should also possess</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You must be curious:</strong>
  Physics is the science of understanding the behavior of the universe. It is explaining the reason why events happen in our environment. It is determining why doing a certain action will cause a particular effect in nature. When we talk about physics, we are not only limited in the world that we are currently in. Physics refers to the whole universe and identifying why the sequence of events occur..</li><br>
        <li><strong>You must not conform to ordinary thinking: </strong>When someone conforms to the usual norm of thinking, you will be restricting yourself to think out of the box. You will not be able to discover new principles that are not existing today if you keep your mind closed about the possibilities. You should allow yourself to explore the opportunity to make new computations and derive new conclusions to explain nature. It is through this character that you will become a great physicist like Einstein.</li><br>
        <li><strong>You must think inductively: </strong>A person who thinks inductively will be able to put things together and arrive at a certain conclusion or reason why things happen. This is a characteristic that you should have to get breakthroughs in your research.</li></ul>
